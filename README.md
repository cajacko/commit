# Commit

This small package simply sets up commitizen globally on your machine and adds the custom conventional commit adapter found at https://github.com/cajacko/cz-conventional-changelog

To install run

```shell
npm i -g @cajacko/commit
```

Now you can commit using the template anywhere on your machine using

```shell
git cz
```

This will run commitizen with the above adapter.
